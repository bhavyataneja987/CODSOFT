**CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION PROJECT**

This repository contains code and resources for building a credit card fraud detection model using a Jupyter Notebook and the Kaggle dataset.

**Overview**
Credit card fraud is a critical concern for financial institutions and cardholders. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can identify fraudulent transactions accurately. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled credit card transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found on Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

Time: The time elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1-V28: Principal components obtained through PCA (to protect user data).
Amount: Transaction amount.
Class: Target variable, where 1 indicates fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates legitimate transaction.

**Prerequisites**
To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the results, you need the following dependencies:

Python (3.x recommended)
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

**Model**
In this project, we employ a supervised machine learning approach. Various algorithms can be used for building the fraud detection model, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Neural Networks
The notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. It also discusses techniques for handling class imbalance, which is a common issue in fraud detection.


Feel free to experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to further improve the model's accuracy and efficiency.
