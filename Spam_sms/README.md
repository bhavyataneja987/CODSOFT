**Spam SMS Prediction Project**
Unwanted spam SMS messages can be a nuisance and a security risk. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of labeled SMS messages as either spam or ham (legitimate).

**Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found on Kaggle: spam.csv

**Prerequisites**
To run the Jupyter Notebook and replicate the results, make sure you have the following dependencies:

Python (3.x recommended)
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

**Model**
For this project, we'll employ a supervised machine learning approach to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. Commonly used algorithms for text classification include:

Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
The notebook explores data preprocessing, text vectorization (e.g., using TF-IDF), model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

**Conclusion**
This project offers an opportunity to delve into the realm of text classification and spam prediction. By working through the provided Jupyter Notebook, you can gain insights into data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation techniques for text-based classification tasks.
